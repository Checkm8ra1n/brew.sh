Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 2.2.0. The most significant changes since 2.1.0 are macOS Catalina support, performance increases and better Homebrew on Linux ecosystem integration.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.1.0:

- [macOS Catalina (10.15) is supported. macOS Sierra (10.12) and older are unsupported.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6500)
- [The no-op case for HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS is dramatically faster and defaults to 5 minutes (rather than 1).](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6532)
- [`brew upgrade` no longer has an unsuccessful error code if the formula is up-to-date.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6728)
- [`brew upgrade`'s post-install dependent checking is dramatically faster and more reliable.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6698)
- [Homebrew on Linux raised their minimum requirements.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6137)
- <https://formulae.brew.sh> [displays Linux formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh/pull/150). When on Linux, [`brew info` outputs Linux analytics data](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6639).
- Homebrew now uses OpenSSL 1.1. OpenSSL 1.0 has been removed as it was EOL by the end of 2019.
- Homebrew will remove Python 2.7 by the end of 2019 as it will be EOL.
- [`brew tap-pin` is disabled](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6704). It was buggy and unused by Homebrew maintainers. Directly reference formulae (e.g. `brew install user/tap/formula`) or rename formulae in taps to avoid shadowing Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae instead.

Other changes since 2.1.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew bundle` outputs `Brewfile.lock.json` files for debugging non-reproducibility.](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle/pull/552)
- [`brew bundle` allows skipping installations by setting environment variables.](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle/pull/486)
- [`sudo brew services` takes root ownership of files when running as root.](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services/pull/188)
- [`--verbose` command output no longer outputs (extremely) long $LOAD_PATH and Ruby paths.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6705)
- [Homebrew uses Ruby 2.6](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6556)
- [`brew cat` sets `bat` as pager if `HOMEBREW_BAT` is set](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6504)
- `brew create` has [`--rust`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6489) and [`--python`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6485) options.
- `brew audit` checks [bitbucket.com](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6425) and [gitlab.com](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6272) repositories for notability.
- Homebrew uses [GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6372) for all non-core repositories.
- [`uses_from_macos`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6162) is a new formula DSL that allows formulae to declare that they use a dependency from the macOS system (rather than from Homebrew). This is useful for additional metadata and automatically installing that dependency on Linux.
- Setting [`HOMEBREW_CURL_RETRIES`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6143) retries `curl` downloads that fail.
- [`brew bump-revision`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5961) increases the `revision` of formulae.
- [All invocations of `brew` are faster.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6032)

Finally:

- Many Homebrew maintainers will be attending [FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/) (say hello!) and will have our AGM afterwards on 3rd February to elect a PLC and Project Leader.
- [Homebrew now accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Homebrew) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
