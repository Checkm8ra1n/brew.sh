Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 2.3.0. The most significant changes since 2.2.0 are GitHub Actions CI usage, fetch before installation, Docker image improvements and the deprecation of `brew install` from URLs.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.2.0:

- [`brew tap-pin` and `brew tap-unpin` have been removed along with the deprecation of some Homebrew and `Formula` methods.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7579)
- [`brew install` from a URL has been deprecated to improve the security of `brew install`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7660)
- [`brew install`, `brew upgrade` and `brew reinstall` now fetch all resources before beginning installation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7124) or [locking dependencies](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7635).
- [The Homebrew/brew Docker image is now built for Ubuntu 16.04 and 20.04 and includes `latest` for the latest stable release and `master` for the `master` branch.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7617)
- [Homebrew formulae can be deprecated or disabled to provide an easier transition than deletion (the previous method).](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7190)
- [Homebrew/homebrew-core has been entirely migrated to GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/6255) and [Homebrew's Jenkins shut down entirely](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7395).

Other changes since 2.2.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew style` and `brew readall` are run on macOS and Linux for Homebrew/brew and Homebrew/homebrew-core to make retaining Linux compatability easier](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7469) and [ease the eventual merging of homebrew-core and linuxbrew-core taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7028).
- [Homebrew searches the entire PATH to find a compatible `ruby`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7545)
- [`brew cask info` shows cask analytics data.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7580)
- [`brew doctor` shows deleted formulae.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7585)
- [`brew uninstall` notes all `etc` files will stay around.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7526)
- [`brew test` runs `pkill` without exceptions to avoid manual cleanup in `test do` blocks.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7368)
- [`pkg-config` correctly sets the `SDKROOT` to find more macOS-provided software.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7277)
- [Formulae can use the `pkgetc` method to install into `etc/#{formula_name}`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7508)
- [Formulae can use the `free_port` test helper.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7225)
- [All Homebrew `curl` requests retry 2 times by default.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7196)
- [Formulae `patch` blocks can change directory to apply their patch.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7132)
- [`brew tap` defaults to full clones. The existing shallow clone default would cause slower `git fetch`s  over time.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6991)
- [`HOMEBREW_BREW_GIT_REMOTE` and `HOMEBREW_CORE_GIT_REMOTE` environment variables allow you to use custom Git mirrors to speed up `brew update` and `brew tap`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6667)

Finally:

- [I (Mike McQuaid) stood down from the Homebrew PLC and was reelected Project Leader. Sean Molenaar joined the PLC.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/6993) (@MikeMcQuaid)
- [Homebrew accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Homebrew) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating.
