Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 3.6.0. The most significant changes since 3.5.0 are preliminary macOS Ventura support, the need for `--eval-all`/`HOMEBREW_EVAL_ALL` and a migration to Ubuntu 22.04 as our CI platform.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.5.0:

- [Homebrew has preliminary macOS 13 (Ventura) support.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13390)
- [Homebrew requires `--eval-all` to be passed or `HOMEBREW_EVAL_ALL` to be set to improve security in cases where it may evaluate formulae or casks that have not been installed, may not be trusted and will execute arbitrary Ruby code](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13790).
- [Homebrew's CI uses Ubuntu 22.04 to e.g. build bottles (binary packages).](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13733)
- [`brew` no longer respects `HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13595). Environment variables needed in formulae or casks need to have a `HOMEBREW_` prefix to be passed through and then reassigned e.g. `ENV["FOO"] = ENV["HOMEBREW_FOO"]`.
- `brew linkage` detects [deprecated linkage to `libnsl.so.1`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13741) and [disabled linkage to `libcrypt.so.1`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13740).
- [Other miscellaneous disabled code has been removed.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13743)

Other changes since 3.5.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` is an opt-in flag added in 3.3.0 to install formulae and casks in homebrew/core and homebrew/cask taps using Homebrew's API instead of needing the (large, slow) local checkouts of these repositories. `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` has had [many](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13439) [improvements](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13440) since 3.5.0. We encourage you to try setting it and [reporting any issues](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/new/choose) you experience.
- [The `postgresql` formula was renamed to `postgresql@14` to avoid repeated breakage on major/minor version upgrades.](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/107726)
- [`HOMEBREW_CURL_PATH` and `HOMEBREW_GIT_PATH` are documented and supported for setting the location of `curl` or `git` on Linux. On macOS, the system versions will still always be used instead.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13423)
- [`HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN` only takes effect on bottles and not e.g. casks.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13258)
- [Periodic `brew cleanup` is run after installing all packages rather than after the first package is installed.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13569)
- [`brew install --debug-symbols` is available to build and retain debug symbols on macOS. This does not yet work on Linux but we'll review a pull request to add it.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13608)
- [`brew install` automatically installs `glibc` or `gcc` if they are too old.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13577)
- [`brew cleanup` and `brew uninstall` automatically run `brew autoremove` if `HOMEBREW_AUTOREMOVE` is set.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13532)
- [`brew fetch --retry` uses an exponential backoff.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13807)
- [`brew deps` returns failing exit code when circular dependencies are detected.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13777)
- [`brew info --json` includes a `variations` key. This provides information about how a formula or cask varies on OSs and CPU architectures other than the one it is being run on](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13589). Various additional DSLs e.g. [`on_system`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13451) and [`arch`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13657) have been added to formulae or casks to facilitate this.
- [A new `Formula` DSL is available to more easily generate completions.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13536)
