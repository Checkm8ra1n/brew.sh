Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.8.0. The most significant changes since 1.7.0 are official Mojave support, linkage auto-repair on `brew upgrade`, `brew info` displaying analytics data and quarantining Caskâ€™s downloads.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.7.0:

- [Download strategies unused by Homebrew/homebrew-core have been deprecated](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5112)
- [We no longer provide support for `devel` specs in Homebrew/homebrew-core (due to CI overhead)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5086)
- [When a bottle isn't available for your version of macOS we will use a bottle from an older version instead](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5100)
- [I (Mike McQuaid) will step down as lead maintainer](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4884) on [February 4th when the Homebrew maintainers meet in person for the first time](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5073)
- [Mojave is officially supported (and El Capitan unsupported)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4950)
- [`brew upgrade` automatically reinstalls or upgrades formulae with broken linkage](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4767)
- [`brew shellenv` outputs configuration variables for Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4849) (and was [reimplemented in Bash for speed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4887))
- [`brew info` displays analytics data. This is the way that Homebrew maintainers query analytics data so we are using the same data as the community.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4830)
- [JSON is used to marshal child process errors to avoid potential security issues](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4819)
- [Homebrew Cask's downloads are quarantined](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4656)
- [`brew extract` is a new command to extract old versions of formulae from Git history](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4563)
- [Homebrew Cask's installs report analytics events](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4620)
- [`brew cask search` and `brew cask cleanup` are deprecated in favour of `brew search` and `brew cleanup`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4670)

Other changes since 1.7.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew gist-logs --private` creates private gists](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5089)
- [Setting `HOMEBREW_FORCE_HOMEBREW_ON_LINUX` disables using Linuxbrew settings when using Homebrew on Linux](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5139)
- [`brew style` checks Bash style with `shellcheck`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5030) and [uses RuboCop RSpec by default](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4948)
- [`brew cleanup` removes old or unnecessary portable Rubies and linkage caches](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5029)
- [`brew linkage` uses a JSON cache to increase reliability](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4984)
- [`brew update-reset` accepts a repository argument](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4932)
- [`bundle install --standalone`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4895) is used to handle vendored gems. This is used to use [ActiveSupport File.atomic_write](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4913), [ActiveSupport Hash#deep_merge](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4912), [`String#delete_prefix` backport](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4906) and [ActiveSupport Object#blank? and #present?](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4902) rather than maintaining our own poor imitations.
- [`brew update` follows GitHub API redirects](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4868)
- [Directories that need to be writable are created automatically and checked more thoroughly](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4844)
- [`brew linkage` data is used to check for multiple simultaneous versioned formulae linkage. This is more permissive than the previous recursive dependency check.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4762)
- [`brew bundle check --verbose` displays what software is missing and causing a `brew bundle check` to fail](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4703)
- [`brew update` prints a one-time donation request](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4682)

Finally:

- Many Homebrew maintainers will be attending [FOSDEM 2019](https://fosdem.org/2019/). Consider coming along and saying hello!
- [Homebrew still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon, [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
