Today, I'd like to announce Homebrew 4.2.0.
The most significant changes since 4.1.0 are some major performance upgrades (e.g. using Ruby 3.1, upgrading fewer dependencies), `.env` file configuration and macOS Sonoma support.

Major changes and deprecations since 4.1.0:

- Homebrew now uses and [requires Ruby 3.1](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16294).
  If you do not already have a version provided by your system: we provide
  [Portable Ruby 3.1.4](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16145) that will be installed whenever needed on
  Linux x86_64 and macOS Apple Silicon and Intel.
  This marks the end of Homebrew using the macOS system Ruby.
  Pour one out for our old friend `/usr/bin/ruby` on macOS üçª.
- [Formula installation and upgrades are less likely to require dependencies to be upgraded.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/15927)
  This should reduce "`brew upgrade foo` upgraded everything on my system" problems.
- Homebrew/homebrew-core and Homebrew/homebrew-cask now store formulae/casks in "sharded" subdirectories for improved `git` and GitHub performance.
- [Homebrew can be configured with `.env` files.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/15787)
- [Homebrew supports macOS Sonoma.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16019)
- [`OS::Mac` and `MacOS` usage in formulae on Linux is deprecated.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16224)
  Please guard all uses in formulae with `if OS.mac?` or `if OS.linux?` as appropriate.
- [`brew audit --new-formula` and `--new-cask` options are deprecated.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16297)
  Please use `brew audit --new` instead.
- [`brew postgresql-upgrade-database` is deprecated.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/15799)
  It is not longer needed now that we use versioned `postgresql` formulae.
  Please use `pg_upgrade` directly instead.
- [Casks can be, like formulae, deprecated and disabled.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16292)
  [Relatedly, the use of `discontinued?` in casks is deprecated.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16352)
- [Various other deprecations.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/15632)
