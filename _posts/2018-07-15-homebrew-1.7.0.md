Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.7.0. The most significant changes since 1.7.0 are fixes for macOS 10.14 Mojave's developer beta, [Homebrew Formulae's](https://formulae.brew.sh) JSON analytics and formulae APIs and various formula API deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.6.0:

- [macOS 10.14 Mojave](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4274) and [Xcode 10](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4275) are now working for some formulae (but not yet supported)
- [Homebrew Formulae now uses HTTPS, provides anonymous aggregate analytics data and has a JSON API for formulae and analytics data](https://formulae.brew.sh)
- [Homebrew Cask's taps have now all moved to the Homebrew GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4193)
- [Setting `HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_GIT` makes Homebrew use a Homebrew-installed rather than system Git](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4377)
- [`brew install` and `upgrade` display all caveats at the end of installing multiple formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4361)
- [Many formula deprecations have been disabled and disabled functions removed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4392)
- [`brew link` does not permit force-linking system dependencies on macOS 10.14 Mojave/CLT 10 and instead outputs the correct compiler flags to use](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4441)
- [The `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` can no longer be in Homebrew's temporary directory](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4397)
- [`brew ls` no longer accepts all `ls` arguments](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4067)

Other changes since 1.6.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [Homebrew now uses Ruby 2.3.7 (like macOS High Sierra 10.13.6)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4461)
- [macOS 10.14 Mojave currently requires the CLT header package (until we have more communication with Apple)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4334)
- [`brew install`, `upgrade` and `reinstall` now have a `--display-times` option to print the install time for each formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4359)
- [`brew linkage` now uses a cache to dramatically speed up the command](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3720)
- [Unspecified but opportunistic linked dependencies are now stored on formula installation and used to correctly generate the list of dependencies for an installed formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3789)
- [Downloading Homebrew's portable Ruby also respects the `HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN` variable](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/4389)
- [The brew.sh websites all look better on mobiles](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.sh/commit/9806592bbd3fb9bb85c83121ebdf892831515490)

Finally:

- [Homebrew still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon we've [updated the README on how to make single donations through PayPal, cheque or wire transfer](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/3568).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
