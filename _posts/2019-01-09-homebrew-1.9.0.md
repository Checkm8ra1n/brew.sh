Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.9.0. The most significant changes since 1.8.0 are Linux support, (optional) automatic `brew cleanup` and providing bottles (binary packages) to more Homebrew users.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.8.0:

- [Homebrew 1.9.0 has beta support for Linux and Windows 10 (with the Windows Subsystem for Linux). Homebrew on Linux (known as Linuxbrew) does not require root access](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5483).
- [`brew cleanup` is run periodically if the `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_CLEANUP` environment variable is set](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5472). [The `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_CLEANUP` environment variable will also trigger individual formula cleanup on reinstall, install or upgrade](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5165). `brew upgrade --cleanup` and `HOMEBREW_UPGRADE_CLEANUP` have been replaced with the `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_CLEANUP` variable. These will become default behaviours in 2.0.0.
- Homebrew 1.9.0 no longer runs on 32-bit Intel CPUs.
- `brew update` no longer migrates legacy keg symlinks, tap names, repository locations, cache locations or cache entries.
- [`brew prune` has been replaced by and is now run as part of `brew cleanup`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5467)
- `brew cask --version` has been replaced with `brew --version` and `brew cask search` with `brew search --cask`.
- The `HOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` environment variable has been deprecated in favour of passing `--build-from-source` to individual formulae installs.
- [`brew install` on macOS uses the same CFLAGS for bottles and building from source](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5491).
- [Homebrew/homebrew-core requires all formulae to be open source by the OSI definition](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5406).
- [`brew link --force` will not link software already provided by macOS](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5383).

Future major changes and deprecations coming in 2.0.0:

- Homebrew 2.0.0 will officially support Linux and Windows 10 (with the Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- `brew cleanup` will be run periodically and for trigger individual formula cleanup on reinstall, install or upgrade. You can enable this behaviour now on 1.9.0 by setting the `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_CLEANUP` variable.
- Homebrew 2.0.0 will not run on macOS 10.8 and below. For 10.4 - 10.6 support see [Tigerbrew](https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew).
- Homebrew 2.0.0 will not be able to create universal binaries (even in taps).
- Homebrew 2.0.0 will no longer migrate old installations from the legacy Homebrew/homebrew repository.
- [Homebrew 2.0.0 will not have any formulae with options in Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/31510). Options will still be supported and encouraged by third-party taps.

Other changes since 1.8.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew info --json` defaults to the latest JSON version and no longer requires a version argument](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5478).
- [The `TERMINFO` environment variable is passed through to Homebrew to enable support for some terminal emulators](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5445).
- [Incomplete downloads can be resumed even when the server rejects HEAD requests](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5421).
- [macOS Mojave bottles are now optimised for the newer CPUs required by Mojave](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5435).
- [`brew`'s ZSH completion performs more caching](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5388).
- [`brew bottle` now allows relocation of more bottles by ignoring source code](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5368) and [skipping matches to build dependencies](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5366).
- [More commands now have robust options handling](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5292).
- [`brew doctor` now outputs the non-default Xcode prefix to ease debugging when Homebrew is using one in a strange location](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5358).
- [`brew upgrade` will not upgrade formulae installed from one tap to formulae installed in another](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5291).
- [Homebrew now has a mission statement](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5223).
- [`Homebrew/brew` contains a `Dockerfile` for building Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5169). This is built automatically on [Linuxbrew's Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxbrew/linuxbrew/).

Finally:

- Many Homebrew maintainers will be attending [FOSDEM 2019](https://fosdem.org/2019/) (say hello!) and meeting afterwards to discuss the future governance of Homebrew.
- [Homebrew still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon (our preferred donation method), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
