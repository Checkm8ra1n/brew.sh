Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 2.4.0. The most significant changes since 2.3.0 are dropping macOS Mavericks support, the deprecation of `devel` versions and `brew audit` speedups.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.3.0:

- [Homebrew's minimum macOS version is Yosemite.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7698)
- [`devel` versions in formulae have been deprecated.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7688)
- [`brew pull` has been deprecated in favour of `hub checkout`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7700)

Other changes since 2.3.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew audit` is significantly faster.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7684)
- [`brew irb` correctly uses `TERMINFO` to improve keyboard handling.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7718)
- [Homebrew uses system Gems correctly.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7681)
- [`man brew` lists the full help for all official external commands (which now includes `brew test-bot`).](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7663)

Finally:

- [Homebrew accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Homebrew) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
