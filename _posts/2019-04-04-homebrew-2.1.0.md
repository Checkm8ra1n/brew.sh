Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 2.1.0. The most significant changes since 2.0.0 are casks on <https://formulae.brew.sh>, search on Homebrew sites and better Docker support.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.0.0:

- <https://formulae.brew.sh> [now displays casks](https://github.com/Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh/issues/13).
- [`brew tap-pin` is deprecated](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5925). It was buggy and unused by Homebrew maintainers. Directly reference formulae (e.g. `brew install user/tap/formula`) or rename formulae in taps to avoid shadowing Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae instead.
- [`brew install --ignore-dependencies` is documented as an unsupported, developer flag](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5970). If you're trying to avoid a command being installed instead consider adjusting your `PATH` so your preferred version precedes it.

Other changes since 2.0.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`brew doctor` reports unreadable, installed formulae.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5974)
- [Homebrew's Formula API is generated by GitHub Actions and displayed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5949) on <https://rubydoc.brew.sh>.
- [`brew` commands avoid auto-updating](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5898) [if no parameters are passed](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5766)
- [`brew extract` works for all taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5887)
- ["Homebrew on Linux" is used consistently instead of "Linuxbrew"](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5867)
- [Search is available on](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5848) <https://formulae.brew.sh>, <https://docs.brew.sh> and <https://brew.sh>
- [New formulae in Homebrew/homebrew-core allow HEAD](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5827)
- [Homebrew on Linux has best-effort support for ARM64 (AArch64)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5802)
- [Homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core) [is used for Linuxbrew's formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5726)
- [Homebrew builds and tests the Dockerhub Linuxbrew/brew Docker image](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5761) (we're working on obtaining the Homebrew name).
- [`brew update` and `brew doctor` warn on deleted taps.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5756)
- [Homebrew allows Docker to run it as `root`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5733)
- [`brew cleanup --prune-prefix` option does what `brew prune` used to](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5721)

Finally:

- [Homebrew's Governance document](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-Governance) [is public](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5739)
- [Mike McQuaid is now the elected Homebrew project lead. A project leadership committee and technical steering committee were also elected.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/5669)
- [Homebrew still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon (our preferred donation method), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
