Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 3.3.0. The most significant changes since 3.2.0 are the migration from [Homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/linuxbrew-core) to [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core) for all Homebrew on Linux users, the official support of macOS Monterey (and, as usual, dropping the support for Mojave due to us only supporting 3 macOS versions) and the addition of an opt-in `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` flag to avoid needing to have Homebrew/homebrew-core or Homebrew/homebrew-cask repositories tapped/cloned locally.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.2.0:

- [`brew update` will migrate all Linux users from linuxbrew-core to homebrew-core. This will also trigger the upgrade of some formulae installed from linuxbrew-core due to `revision` differences.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12248)
- [macOS Monterey is officially supported](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12263) and [requires Xcode 13.1](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12262). Monterey ships with Ruby 2.6.8 so we've released and use [Portable Ruby 2.6.8](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12281).
- [`HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` is a new opt-in flag to install formulae and casks in homebrew/core and homebrew/cask taps using Homebrew's API instead of needing the (large, slow) local checkouts of these repositories.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12305)
- [`brew bump-formula-pr --write` has been deprecated in favour of `brew bump-formula-pr --write-only`.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12223)
- [The Internet Archive uploader was broken and no-one noticed so it has been removed.](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/12130)

will fetch all formulae before attempting installation.
- [`brew install` outputs all cask installations at the end (like formulae).](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/11966)
