Finally:

- [Discourse](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9144) and [IRC](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8981) are now deprecated as official communication methods in favour of [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/8802). It will be made read-only on January 1st 2021.
- [Homebrew accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Homebrew) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!
