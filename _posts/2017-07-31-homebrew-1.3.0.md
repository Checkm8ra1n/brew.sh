Today I'd like to announce Homebrew 1.3.0. The most significant change since 1.2.0 is that `brew install python` no longer installs a `python` binary without manual `PATH` additions and instead installs a `python2` binary. This avoids overriding the system `python` binary by default when installing Python as a dependency. It also paves the way to eventually have `python` be Python 3.x.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.2.0:

- [`brew install` (and `upgrade`/`reinstall`) use the macOS sandbox for all builds by default](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2898)
- [`revision` is deprecated in favour of `rebuild` in `bottle do` blocks](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2899)
- [`fails_with :llvm` is deprecated as it's always a no-op](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2899)
- [versioned aliases' `opt` links for taps are created based on their name and not in subdirectories](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2923)
- [`brew link` and `brew unlink` state is preserved after `brew install` and `brew upgrade` (including for keg-only formulae)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2961)
- [`brew test` requires non-keg-only formulae to be linked](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2816)
- [events we didn't use are no longer reported to analytics](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2752)
- [`BuildErrors` reported to analytics now include the requested formula installation options](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2758)

While all the functionality for these deprecations will be supported for the foreseeable future in [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) for 3rd-party usage, [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) has removed the use of these APIs from formulae to improve the user experience.

Other changes since 1.2.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`default_formula` are always used when pouring bottles again](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2969)
- [`brew --prefix` is faster](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2940)

- [versions are detected](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2827) [more reliably from URLs](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2931)
- [you can `brew install` formulae whose dependency trees require more than one version of the same `:build`-time dependency](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2954)
- [`:build`-time requirements are no longer fatal when installing from bottles](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2815)
- [`brew edit` will use `atom` if available](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2749)
